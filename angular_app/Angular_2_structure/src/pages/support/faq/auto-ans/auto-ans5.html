            <p>Yes if you have rental coverage on your policy. It is important to be aware of your daily/policy limits - if you select a rental car that costs more than your policy provides for, you may be responsible for the difference. Your adjuster will discuss your rental coverage if available, including the amount of the rental that will be covered based upon your damage estimate.</p>
