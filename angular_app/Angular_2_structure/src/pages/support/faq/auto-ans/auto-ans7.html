  <p>If you choose to use a repair shop that is not part of the Hanover Express Claims Auto Repair Program, here are a couple of pointers to assist you:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Your adjuster will guide you on obtaining an appraisal from Hanover so you can take it to the shop of your choice. Once agreement has been reached between you, your shop, and the Hanover on repairs and cost, you may authorize the work to begin.</li>
  <li>Hanover will pay you directly (and the appropriate leinholder if applicable) for the repair unless you choose to sign "Direction to Pay" to the shop. This will authorize us to pay the shop directly.</li>
  </ul>
