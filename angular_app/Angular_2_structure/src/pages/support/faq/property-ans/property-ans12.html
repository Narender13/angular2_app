            <p>A standard homeowners policy does not cover flood* damage. If you are in a flood zone, we recommend you discuss your need for flood coverage with your agent. * The standard homeowner policy provides no coverage for flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not the water is driven by wind. There is no coverage for ground water seepage or leaking, nor is there coverage for water that backs up through sewers, sumps or drains. It is important to note that coverage for loss caused by those perils is excluded even if another peril also causes or contributes to the loss.</p>
