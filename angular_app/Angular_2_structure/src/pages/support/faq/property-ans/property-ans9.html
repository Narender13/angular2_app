            <p>Depending on the cause and age of the leak, there may be coverage for the interior stains on the ceiling.  However, there would be no coverage for any personal property contained in the building unless the storm first caused an actual opening in the roof or wall and the precipitation entered through that opening causing direct damage to the personal property.
