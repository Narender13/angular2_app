            <p>Once you have filed a claim, an adjuster will be assigned who will manage the details and guide you through the claim process. As part of that process, you will receive a copy of an estimate and a statement of your loss. This statement will explain your replacement cost benefits and guide you with how to recover any amount that may be available. Once your claim has been settled, any payments due will be sent to you in the mail by check, with the details of the amount outlined on the last page of your estimate.</p>
