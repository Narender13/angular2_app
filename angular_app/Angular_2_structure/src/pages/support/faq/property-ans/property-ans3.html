            <p><strong>What is Recoverable Depreciation?</strong></p>

            <p>Depreciation is defined as a decrease in value of any property due to wear, tear, and/or time. In some cases, depreciation may be listed on an estimate as "recoverable depreciation". Recoverable depreciation means a provision may be made for you to collect the depreciated value after the completion of the repair. If this is the case, simply forward the final bill/invoice/proof of payment from the repairer to your adjuster, who will review any additional allowances due based on the actual expenses incurred. (NOTE: A re-inspection may be required of completed repairs)</p>
