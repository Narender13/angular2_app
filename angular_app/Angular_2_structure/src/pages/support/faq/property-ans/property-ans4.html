            <p>If additional damages are found, it is important you contact your adjuster as soon as possible. Your adjuster may ask you to forward a copy of the estimate from your contractor that reflects these additional discovered damages. It is important to note that any supplemental payments will only be made upon review and prior approval.</p>
