            <p>Your neighbor should contact their homeowner or auto insurer immediately about the damage. If your neighbor is demanding you pay for the damage or if their insurance carrier has contacted you regarding the damage to their property please report a claim to us or your local agent as soon as possible. Admitting liability or volunteering to make payment to your neighbor or any other party may jeopardize the availability of liability coverage.</p>
