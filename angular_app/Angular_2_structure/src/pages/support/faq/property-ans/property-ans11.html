            <p><strong>What happens if my power goes out and my food spoils? Do I have coverage?</strong></p>

            <p>Yes, if the power interruption is caused by damage that happened to your premises. Your basic homeowner policy does not provide food spoilage coverage in the event of a widespread power outage, however Hanover has an endorsement that you can add to your policy that provides a limited amount of coverage, subject to a special deductible, for spoilage caused by an off-premises power outage or by mechanical failure of the freezer or refrigerator. Your Agent can assist you and answer any additional questions about this coverage.</p>
