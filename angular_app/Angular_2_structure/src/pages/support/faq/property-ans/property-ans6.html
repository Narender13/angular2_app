            <p><strong>One of my trees fell during a storm. Do I have coverage to remove the tree?

            <p>Yes, if a tree(s) damages your home or garage (or other "covered structure"), your homeowners policy covers you up to $500 to remove the tree(s) once it has been lifted off the structure, regardless of the number of fallen trees. The cost to cut and/or lift a fallen tree off of the "covered structure" and drop it to the ground will be calculated as part of the cost to repair that structure and will not be subject to the $500 limit. However, there is no coverage for trees that are leaning or for trees that fall onto plants or lawns. Tree removal coverage only applies if the tree damages a "covered structure".</p>
