            <p>You may see some granules from your shingles after a hail storm; this is a common occurrence with hail. Fortunately, roofing and engineering experts agree that in most cases, loss of granules is consistent with the roof performing as designed and that the life expectancy of the roof will not be compromised by such an event. If there is visible damage, methods of repair can range from the replacement of damaged roof parts and individual shingles to the replacement of a damaged slope. An inspection of the roof will be required on all reported hail damage claims so we can determine whether there has been any covered damage to the roof and, if so, what method of repair may be necessary.</p>
