            <p>To help prevent damage, we recommend you make any necessary "emergency repairs", such as installing an emergency tarp. Be sure to save all receipts and records of the repair for your adjuster.  If possible, take photos of the damage before proceeding with any temporary repairs so the adjuster can have documentation of the original damage. Your Hanover adjuster will make note of the damages, and detail in their report of what is covered under your policy provisions.</p>
