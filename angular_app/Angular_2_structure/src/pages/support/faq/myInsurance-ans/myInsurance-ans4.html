            <p>A declarations page (sometimes referred to as a dec page) is the portion of your policy documents that contains a listing of the coverages you have selected for your vehicle, home, or other property. This page(s) offers important details such as covered address/vehicles, coverage type, limits, discounts, credits, and total premium. It may also contain messages that could direct you to other policy documents for additional detail - such as a listing of endorsements that have been added to tailor your coverage for your specific lifestyle needs. You will receive a declarations page as part of your policy package when you become a new customer and upon each renewal.</p>
