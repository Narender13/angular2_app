            <p>Avoiding billing fees is easy when you sign up for Recurring EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) to pay your premium! Additionally there are no fees to pay your bill online or by calling 800-573-1187. However, if you prefer to have your premium billed on a payment plan, your policy/account will be charged an invoice fee (amount varies by state). NOTE: If your payment is returned to us for non-sufficient funds, you will be charged a fee.</p>
