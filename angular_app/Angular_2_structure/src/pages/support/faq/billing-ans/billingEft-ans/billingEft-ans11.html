            <p>Your bank may make up to 2 additional attempts to collect the amount due. All bank returns for insufficient or uncollectible funds will be subject to a fee. Your bank may also charge a fee for each attempt. If your recurring EFT payment is dishonored by your bank, we will remove your policy (s) from recurring EFT and send a notice of intent to cancel for non-payment of premium.</p>
